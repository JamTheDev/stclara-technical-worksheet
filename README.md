# Stclara Technical Worksheet

## Overview
The project is an application built with React, Redux, and Next.js. It uses Supabase as the backend for data persistence and authentication. The application provides core functionalities to create, update, delete, and list todo items.

## Technologies Used
- **React & Next.js:** For building the UI and handling server-side/client-side rendering.
- **Redux Toolkit:** For state management with async actions.
- **Supabase:** For database operations and user authentication.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling components with utility-first classes.
- **Prisma ORM:** For Designing Database Models without leaving the Editor.
- **TypeScript:** For type safety across the project.

## Key Features
- **Persistent Authentication:**  
    Seamlessly manage user sessions with robust authentication mechanisms.
- **CRUD Secrets:**  
    Securely create, read, update, and delete secret entries.
- **CRUD Food Gallery with Review:**  
    Manage a food gallery with full CRUD support, including a detailed review system.
- **CRUD Pokemon Gallery with Review:**  
    Handle a dynamic Pokemon gallery that supports CRUD operations and user reviews.
- **CRUD Markdown Notes:**  
    Efficiently create, edit, delete, and organize markdown notes.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
    - Use your preferred Git client or terminal, e.g., git clone <repository-url>
2. Open the project in your favorite text editor or IDE.
3. Install dependencies:
    - Run yarn install, pnpm install, or npm install based on your package manager.
4. If working locally, migrate all database models:
    - Run npx prisma migrate dev (or the equivalent yarn command)
5. Start the application:
    - Execute yarn|pnpm|npm run next
6. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

## Code Quality Rating
- **DRY:** 8/10  
    The code avoids duplication in how API calls and state actions are implemented. Abstracting API calls into async actions helps maintain a DRY structure.

- **KISS:** 7/10  
    While the separation between UI components, actions, and configuration leads to clarity, some parts (like error handling and state updates) can be further simplified for better maintainability.

## Recommendations
- **Simplify Error Handling:**  
    Consider centralizing error logging and handling to reduce repeated code blocks.
    
- **Enhance Separation of Concerns:**  
    Further modularize UI components and consider custom hooks for state management to isolate business logic.
    
- **Improve Documentation:**  
    Continue adding inline comments and developer notes to assist future maintainers in understanding both the data flow and configuration dependencies.
